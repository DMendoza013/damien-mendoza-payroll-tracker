# Payroll-tracker

## Description

This payroll-tracker allows the user to enter in employee names with their salary. It will keep track of all the employee names and their assigned salaries. A list will be created once all of the names and salaries are entered. The Chrome DevTools console tells you the average employee salary and also chooses a random employee.

## Credits

I used starter code for this assignment. Here is a link to it: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curly-potato

I used AskBCS Learning Assistant and they helped me with adding an object to an array.

I also used stackoverflow to help me set up the idea for the displayAverageSalary function: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20905354/javascript-calculating-the-average-of-an-array-using-for-loop

## Comment

This is my second time creating this repo. When I tried to deploy on Github Pages the first time, it wasn't working as intended. I ended up just recreating the repo and starting over.
